# NomadNet-Pages
Various small example pages/programs for usage with the NomadNet node server or rns_server_page.

You are welcome to use them for your own use as a program or as inspiration for your own developments.

These files are only an example and are not completely developed or documented.


### Current Status:
It should currently be considered beta software and still work in progress.

All core features are implemented and functioning, but additions will probably occur as real-world use is explored.

There may be errors or the compatibility after an update is no longer guaranteed.

The full documentation is not yet available. Due to lack of time I can also not say when this will be further processed.


### Install:
- Copy the files into the NomadNet page folder.

- Make it executable with the following command
  ```bash
  chmod +x
  ```
